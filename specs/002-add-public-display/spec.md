# Feature Specification: Public Display Geohash for Community Discovery

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-public-display`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add public display geohash for fog-of-war discovery feature that shows approximate community locations on a map with 1km radius circles while preserving exact location privacy"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Privacy-preserving community discovery system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: public users (non-members), community members, community creators
   ‚Üí Actions: discover communities, view approximate locations, maintain privacy
   ‚Üí Data: display geohash, fog radius, actual location
   ‚Üí Constraints: 1km radius circles, location privacy preservation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Water/inaccessible area handling marked for clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows defined for discovery and privacy validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable with specific criteria
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Display location metadata identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN: Some clarifications needed for edge cases
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a potential community member, I want to discover nearby communities on a map without knowing their exact location, so I can explore my area while community locations remain private until I physically find them.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a community exists at a specific location, **When** a non-member views the discovery map, **Then** they see a fog circle with 1km radius that contains the actual location somewhere within it
2. **Given** multiple communities exist in an area, **When** viewing the discovery map, **Then** each community shows its own fog circle which may overlap with others
3. **Given** a user is viewing the discovery map, **When** they see a fog circle, **Then** they cannot determine the exact location of the QR code within that circle
4. **Given** a community creator scans a new QR code, **When** the community is created, **Then** a randomized display point is generated within 750m of the actual location
5. **Given** a display point would fall in water or inaccessible area, **When** generating the location, **Then** the system attempts alternative points or falls back to the actual location

### Edge Cases
- What happens when display point lands in water/ocean? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we detect and regenerate, or allow it?]
- How does system handle multiple communities very close together (overlapping fog circles)?
- What happens if no valid display point can be found after multiple attempts?
- Should display points be regenerated periodically for additional privacy? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Static or rotating display points?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a display location for each community that is randomly offset from the actual location
- **FR-002**: Display location MUST be within 750 meters of the actual community location
- **FR-003**: System MUST show fog circles with exactly 1km radius centered on display locations
- **FR-004**: Actual community location MUST always be within the displayed fog circle
- **FR-005**: Display locations MUST be visible to non-members on a discovery map
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT reveal actual community location to users who haven't physically validated
- **FR-007**: Display location MUST be stored as a 9-character geohash for approximately 19m x 9.5m precision
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve existing 8-character geohash for actual location validation
- **FR-009**: Display points SHOULD avoid water bodies and inaccessible areas [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Detection method and fallback behavior]
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain display location consistency once generated (not change on each view)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Display Location**: A randomized point near the actual community location, stored as metadata, used as center for fog circles on discovery maps
- **Fog Circle**: A 1km radius circle shown on the map, centered on display location, indicating approximate area where community exists
- **Community Location**: The actual QR code location, kept private, only validated when users are physically present
